//! \section CORE_Peripherals 2. Cortex -Mx Peripherals 
//! - SysTick 
//! - Provides a simple, 24-bit clear-on-write, decrementing, wrap-on-zero counter
//! - with a flexible control mechanism.
//! - Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC) 
//! - Facilitates low-latency exception and interrupt handling
//! - Controls power management
//! - Implements system control registers
//! - System Control Block (SCB) 
//! - Provides system implementation information and system control, including
//! configuration, control,and reporting of system exceptions.
//! - Memory Protection Unit (MPU) 
//! - Supports the standard ARMv7 Protected Memory System Architecture (PMSA)
//! model. The MPU provides full support for protection regions, overlapping
//! protection regions, access permissions,and exporting memory attributes to
//! the system.
//! .
//! 
//! \section CORE_Function_Desc 3. CORE Functional Description
//! 
//! \subsection CORE_Spe_Reg_Control 3.1 CORE Special register access
//! 
//! The core driver will access Special register As following:
//! - \b PRIMASK
//! - \b BASEPRI
//! - \b psp
//! - \b msp
//! .
//! 
//! \subsection CORE_Int_Control 3.2 NVIC Control
//! 
//! \subsubsection CORE_Int_Enable 3.2.1 NVIC Interrupt Enable
//! 
//! The specified interrupt is enabled in the interrupt controller.  Other
//! enables for the interrupt (such as at the peripheral level) are unaffected
//! by this function. 
//! 
//! \subsubsection CORE_Int_Disable 3.2.2 NVIC Interrupt Disable
//! 
//! The specified interrupt is disabled in the interrupt controller.  Other
//! disables for the interrupt (such as at the peripheral level) are unaffected
//! by this function. 
//! 
//! \subsubsection CORE_Int_Pending 3.2.3 NVIC Interrupt Pending
//! 
//! If the pend is set,The specified interrupt is pended in the interrupt controller. 
//! This will cause the interrupt controller to execute the corresponding interrupt
//! handler at the next available time, based on the current interrupt state
//! priorities.  For example, if called by a higher priority interrupt handler,
//! the specified interrupt handler will not be called until after the current
//! interrupt handler has completed execution.  The interrupt must have been
//! enabled for it to be called.
//!
//! If the pend is clear,The specified interrupt is unpended in the interrupt controller.  
//! This will cause any previously generated interrupts that have not been handled yet
//! (due to higher priority interrupts or the interrupt no having been enabled
//! yet) to be discarded.
//! 
//! \subsubsection CORE_Int_Priority 3.2.4 NVIC Interrupt Priority
//! 
//! When multiple interrupts are asserted simultaneously, the ones with the highest 
//! priority are processed before the lower priority interrupts.  Smaller numbers
//! correspond to higher interrupt priorities; priority 0 is the highest
//! interrupt priority.
//!
//! The hardware priority mechanism will only look at the upper N bits of the
//! priority level (where N is 2 for the NUC1xx family), so any
//! prioritization must be performed in those bits.  The remaining bits can be
//! used to sub-prioritize the interrupt sources, and may be used by the
//! hardware priority mechanism on a future part.  This arrangement allows
//! priorities to migrate to different NVIC implementations without changing
//! the gross prioritization of the interrupts.
//! 
//! NVIC can also split between preemptable priority levels and
//! subpriority levels in the interrupt priority specification.  The range of
//! the grouping values are dependent upon the hardware implementation; on
//! the NUC1xx family, Cortex -M0 as it is ,do not support it.
//! 
//! \subsection CORE_xSysTick_Control 3.3 SysTick Control
//! 
//! SysTick provides a simple, 24-bit clear-on-write, decrementing, wrap-on-zero
//! counter with a flexible control mechanism. The counter can be used as a Real 
//! Time Operating System (RTOS) tick timer or as a simple counter.
//!
//! When system timer is enabled, it will count down from the value in the SysTick Current Value
//! Register (SYST_CVR) to zero, and reload (wrap) to the value in the SysTick Reload Value
//! Register (SYST_RVR) on the next clock cycle, then decrement on subsequent clocks. When the
//! counter transitions to zero, the COUNTFLAG status bit is set. The COUNTFLAG bit clears on reads.
//! 
//!
//! \section xCORE_API_Group 4. API Groups
//! The CoX Core API is broken into 3 groups of functions: 
//! - those that wrapping CPU instruction. 
//! - those that deal with interrupts.
//! - those that deal with systick.
//! .
//! \subsection xCORE_API_Group_Cpu 4.1 CPU instruction wrapping API
//! CPSID/CSPIE instruction:
//! - xCPUcpsid()
//! - xCPUcpsie()
//! - xCPUprimask()
//! .
//! BASEPRI read/write with:
//! - xCPUbasepriGet()
//! - xCPUbasepriSet()
//! .
//! WFI instruction:
//! - xCPUwfi()
//! .
//! PSP read/write with:
//! - xCPUpspGet()
//! - xCPUpspSet()
//! .
//! MSP read/write with:
//! - xCPUmspGet()
//! - xCPUmspSet()
//! .
//!
//! \subsection xCORE_API_Group_Int 4.2 Interrupt API
//! Interrupt enable/disable by:
//! - xIntMasterEnable(), xIntMasterDisable()
//! - xIntEnable(), xIntDisable()
//! .
//! The interrupt priority is deal with: 
//! - xIntPriorityGroupingSet(), xIntPriorityGroupingGet()
//! - xIntPrioritySet(), xIntPriorityGet()
//! - xIntPriorityMaskSet(), xIntPriorityMaskGet()
//! .
//! The interrupt can be pending with:
//! - xIntPendSet(),  xIntPendClr()
//! - xPendSVPendSet(), xPendSVPendClr()
//! - xSysTickPendSet(), xSysTickPendClr()
//! .
//!
//! \subsection xCORE_API_Group_Systick 4.3 Systick API
//! The Systick is enable/disable with:
//! - xSysTickEnable()
//! - xSysTickDisable()
//! .
//! The Systick interrupt is enable/disable with:
//! - xSysTickIntEnable()
//! - xSysTickIntDisable()
//! .
//! The Systick is controled by:
//! - xSysTickPeriodSet()
//! - xSysTickPeriodGet()
//! - xSysTickValueGet()
